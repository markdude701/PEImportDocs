<h1>Step 2: FTP/SFTP BACKUP </h1>
<p>Note: It is not required to backup FTP/SFTP before SQL. Both will backup fine regardless of the order.</p>

<ol>
<li>Log into DreamHost</li>
<li>Once logged in, locate the left side panel and select "FTP & SSH Users"</li>
<img src="./images/FTP1.png"/>
<li>From the drop down, select "Manage Users"</li>
<img src="./images/FTP2.png" />
<li>All FTP accounts will now be displayed.</li>
<img src="./images/FTP3.png" />
<li>Locate the FTP user associated to your domain and click "Show Info"</li>
<img src="./images/FTP4.png" />
<li>The host, username, and port will be listed. Put this information aside for Step 12. Click "Reset Password"</li>
<img src="./images/FTP5.png" />
<li>Input a new password into the text field and click the blue "Reset Password" button</li>
<img src="./images/FTP6.png" />
<li>DreamHost may take a few minutes to reset the SFTP password</li>
<img src="./images/FTP7.png" />
<li>Once the password is reset, the same panel in FTP users will be diplayed showing the new password. You have successfull changed and acquired the SFTP/FTP password.</li>
<img src="./images/FTP8.png" />
<li>Using the host, username, and password, we start setting up to connect via SFTP/FTP </li>
<p>You can use DreamHost's "Manage Files" button in the top right of the FTP/SFTP user or an external FTP client. I reccomend using Filezilla as it is often faster and more reliable than browser transfers. </p>
<p>You can <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client">download Filezilla from their website here</a> </p>

<li>Open FileZilla. The window should lool similar to the image below.  </li>
<img src="./images/FTP9.png" />
<li>Next, input your host, username, password, and port and click "Quick Connect". This information was collected in Step 9</li>
<img src="./images/FTP10.png" />
<li>You may be alerts to an "Unknown Host Key". Click "OK"</li>
<img src="./images/FTP11.png" />
<li>Upon successfully connecting, you will see the sever contents appear in the right-side panel.</li>
<p>The left side is your local directory/PC. </p>
<img src="./images/FTP12.png" />
<li>Navigate in the left panel to where you would like to store your backup. Then drag and drop your domain from the right panel to the left. </li>
<img src="./images/FTP13.png" />
<li>You will see activity in "Queued Files" section at the bottom of FileZilla signifying the transfer of files. This process can take 5-120 minutes to complete depending on the website, computer, and server, so feel free to grab a coffee or something while we wait.</li>
<img src="./images/FTP14.png" />
<li>Upon completion, the "Queued Files" section mentioned in the previous step will be empty. </li>
<p>For reference, the basic WordPress installation used in this example transfered 5,911 files in total. </p>
<img src="./images/FTP15.png" />
<li>The SFTP/FTP transfer is now complete.</li>
</ol>
